## Bank App

Bank App is a simple, yet powerful CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application developed with Flask and SQLAlchemy. It manages bank details such as bank name and location.

CRUD refers to the four basic operations you can perform on data in a database or similar storage: create, read, update, and delete. In the context of a web application, this usually translates to POST, GET, PUT/PATCH, and DELETE HTTP methods.

### Features

üè¶ Create Bank: Allows you to add new banks with their name and location.

üìö Read/List Banks: Enables you to view a list of all created banks.

‚úèÔ∏è Update Bank: Provides the ability to edit the name or location of an existing bank.

üóëÔ∏è Delete Bank: Gives you the option to remove a bank from the system.
